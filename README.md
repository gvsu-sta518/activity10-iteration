Activity 10 - Iteration
================

For this activity, it is assumed that you read Sections 21.1 - 21.5 from
R4DS, Chapter 7 from Modern Dive, and Chapter 20 from R Programming for
Data Science.

In this activity, you will:

-   Apply a function to every item in a vector using a `for` loop.
-   Apply a function to every item in a vector using `{purrr}`
    functions.

## ☑️ Task 1: The Workflow

![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** this repo and clone it to a
new [RStudio Project](https://rstudio.gvsu.edu/).

Remember that more detailed directions can be found in [Task 1 of
Activity
6](https://github.com/gvsu-sta518/activity06-pivoting#%EF%B8%8F-task-1-the-workflow).

<b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you have any questions, contact your
instructor or another group.

## ☑️ Task 2: Complete the RMarkdown File

The `activity10-iteration.Rmd` file contains the directions for this
activity. For the rest of this class period, you will complete the
RMarkdown document with your neighbor(s). Your instructor will be
circling and be available to help when needed.

Note that each person is working in their own repo. We are not worrying
about collaborating for the time being and instead will be working on
being more comfortable with the workflow for working between RStudio and
GitHub.

However, do not continue in this README document until you and your
neighbor(s) have completed your `.Rmd` files.

## ☑️ Task 3: Reflection

This is the end of the activities for preparing data. What do you feel
like you have a good grasp of? What could you use more practice with?

**Next**: Next week we will extend iterating to two statistical methods:
simulations and bootstrapping.
